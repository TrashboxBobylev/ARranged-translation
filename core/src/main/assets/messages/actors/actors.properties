actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_dust=I'm looking for some _corpse dust._ It's a special kind of cursed bone meal that usually shows up in places like this. There should be a barricaded room around here somewhere, I'm sure some dust will turn up there.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_ember=I'm looking for some _fresh embers_ from a newborn fire elemental.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here. Try to _keep away from its vine lashers_ if you want to stay in one piece. Using fire might be tempting but please don't, you'll kill the plant and destroy its seeds.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_2=\n\nIf you can get that for me, I'll be happy to pay you with one of my finely crafted wands! I brought two with me, so you can take whichever one you prefer.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of dwarven flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the dwarves that have died in this region. Clearly the demons see no issue with using every resource they can against their enemies.\n\nWhile visually terrifying, demon spawners have no means of moving or directly defending themselves.

Killing them may weaken it._

actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison. Their electrical shocks proved too weak however, and so they were gifted to the human city above. They went unused for years and eventually found their way to the prison, where the warden initially deemed them too cruel to use. However, as the prisoners became more unruly they became a necessity.

They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The dwarves briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.dm300.desc=The DM-300 is the largest and most powerful 'defense machine' that the dwarves ever built. Such an awesome machine is difficult to manufacture, so the dwarves only ever made a few to guard the entrances to their underground metropolis.\n\nIt is equipped with vents to jet its toxic exhaust fumes and a high power drill that it can use both to attack and disrupt the earth. DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.
